We're still super early stage and with each small team, it's a startup within itself which means defining a problem, talking to users, building a solution, and iterating on that. As a former founder, you might come from a background in Engineering, Product, Design, or Marketing (or all of them)! We'll always have a place for smart, motivated people and we will work with you to define your own role at PostHog!",
